Monitoring::Icinga
==================

This module provides an API to Icinga using the Icinga Web REST API.

For now, the functionality of this module is similar to
Nagios::Status::HostStatus and Nagios::Status::ServiceStatus, except that it
doesn't work like them.

For now it is only possible to get objects from Icinga. Later it will also be
possible to change things (i.e. reschedule checks) on the server.
